== Welcome to WeFarm

WeFarm is an online farmers market. It is a demo marketplace built using WePay API to demonstrate the ease of using WePay to build a complete marketplace that processes payments between buyers and merchants. You can use this demo to build different applications that support various use cases like consumer-to-consumer platforms for products or services, fund-raising websites, subscription services, etc.

Visit https://stage.wepay.com/developer/platform/wefarm-tutorial for a complete tutorial. You can play with a live demo of this application at http://wefarm.herokuapp.com/. The demo does not process real payments. You can test using fake data.

Before starting, you will need WePay client id and client secret for your app. You can get them by registering your app at WePay - https://www.wepay.com/developer/register. Change those values in config/environments/development.rb file of the project before you begin.
