== Welcome to WeFarm

WeFarm is an online farmers market. It is a demo marketplace built using WePay API to demonstrate the ease of using WePay to easily build a complete marketplace that processes payments between buyers and merchants. You can use this demo to build different marketplaces that support various use cases like consumer-to-consumer platforms selling products or services, fund-raising websites, subscription services, etc.

Visit https://stage.wepay.com/developer/platform/wefarm-tutorial for a complete guide on building WeFarm. You can play with a live demo of this application here - http://wefarm.herokuapp.com/. The demo does not process real payments. You can test using fake data - https://www.wepay.com/developer/reference/testing.

Before starting, you will need WePay client id and client secret for your app. You can get them by registering your app at WePay - https://www.wepay.com/developer/register. Change those values in config/environments/development.rb file of the project before you begin.
